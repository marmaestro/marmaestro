### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Mar
My passions are videogames and music, I'm trying to work on both of them in the future. I love learning about programming, specially algorithm analysis and creative programming, which I'd like to be specialized on in the future.


- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying last year of videogame design and development.
- ðŸ’» This year I'm pushing my personal boundaries by working with **Unity**, **Godot**, and other game engines.
- ðŸ’¬ As before, I will keep making public some relevant academic work and results from game jams I participate in on [itch.io](https://marmaestro.itch.io).
- ðŸ“« You can also reach me through email (marmaestro@pm.me).
- ðŸ“ƒ My portfolio is at [marmaestro.github.io](https://marmaestro.github.io).
-  ðŸ”­ I'm working on my bachelor's thesis, a game project currently aiming for a vertical slice. There's more info on its [itch.io](https://marmaestro.itch.io/stillilinger) page.
