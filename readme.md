### Hi there 👋 I’m Mar
My passions are videogames and music, I'm trying to work on both of them in the future. I love learning about programming, specially algorithm analysis and creative programming, which I'd like to be specialized on in the future.


- 📚 I'm currently studying fourth year of videogame design and development.
- 💻 This year I'm spreading my personal boundaries by working with **Unity**, **Godot**, **Murder**, and other game engines.
- 🦢 I'm part of a two-person game studio, Punic Goose, with my dear friend [Alan](https://github.com/AlbertoAlanSA). You can check our [itch.io](https://punicgoose.itch.io) to follow our work.
- 💬 As before, I will keep making public some of my academic work and results from game jams I participate in on my personal [itch.io](https://marmaestro.itch.io).
- 📫 You can also reach me through email (marmaestromomparler@gmail.com).

-  🔭 I'm working on two game projects right now!! My developing logs are on [my Tumblr blog](https://marmaestro.tumblr.com).
