### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Mar
My passions are videogames and music, I'm trying to work on both of them in the future. I love learning about programming, specially algorithm analysis and creative programming, which I'd like to be specialized on in the future.


- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying fourth year of videogame design and development.
- ðŸ’» This year I'm spreading my personal boundaries by working with **Unity**, **Godot**, **Murder**, and other game engines.
-  ðŸ”­ I'm working on two game projects right now!! My developing logs are on [my Tumblr blog](https://marmaestro.tumblr.com).
- ðŸ¦¢ I'm part of a two-person game studio, Punic Goose, with my dear friend [Alan](https://github.com/AlbertoAlanSA). You can check our [itch.io](https://punicgoose.itch.io) to follow our progress.
- ðŸ’¬ As before, I will keep making public some of my academic work and results from game jams I participate in on my [itch.io](https://marmaestro.itch.io).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through email (marmaestromomparler@gmail.com).
