## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Mar
> My passions are videogames and music, I'm trying to work on both of them in the future. I love learning about programming, specially algorithm analysis and creative programming, which I'd like to be specialized on in the future.
- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying third year of videogame design and development. 
- ðŸ’» This year, I'm focusing on **C#** for Unity development, **C** for OS workflows and **Kotlin** for Android development.
- ðŸ”­ Not working on any projects outside of university stuff right now (that's why all my repositories are private!).
- ðŸ’¬ Although, I will release some of my academic work and results from game jams I participate in on my [itch.io](https://marmaestro.itch.io).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through email (marmaestromomparler@gmail.com).
