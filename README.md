## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m mar
Videogame development and algorithm analysis.
> My passions are videogames and music, I'd love to work on both of them in the future.
I love learning about programming and specially algorithm analysis and creative programming, which I'd like to be specialized on in the future.
- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying videogame design and development. 
- ðŸ’» This year I'm focusing on **C++** for algotithmic analysis, **JavaScript** for web games and **SQL** for databases.
- ðŸ”­ Not looking to collaborate on anything right now, but joining a small project to gain experience with other learners would be amazing.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my personal email (marmaemom@gmail.com) or my personal twitter ([@mfalsomni](https://twitter.com/mfalsomni)) for more informal sutff.
