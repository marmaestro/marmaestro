## Hi there 👋 I’m Mar
> My passions are videogames and music, I'm trying to work on both of them in the future. I love learning about programming, specially algorithm analysis and creative programming, which I'd like to be specialized on in the future.
- 📚 I'm currently studying videogame design and development. 
- 💻 This year I'm focusing on **C++** for algotithmic analysis, **JavaScript** for web games and **SQL** for databases.
- 🔭 Not working on any projects outside of university stuff right now (that's why all my repositories are private!).
- 📫 You can reach me through my personal email (marmaemom@gmail.com).
