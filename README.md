## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Mar
> My passions are videogames and music, I'm trying to work on both of them in the future. I love learning about programming, specially algorithm analysis and creative programming, which I'd like to be specialized on in the future.
- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying videogame design and development. 
- ðŸ’» This year I'm focusing on **C++** for algotithmic analysis, **JavaScript** for web games and **SQL** for databases.
- ðŸ”­ Only working on university stuff right now, joining a small project in the sector to gain experience would be amazing.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my personal email (marmaemom@gmail.com).
